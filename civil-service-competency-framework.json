  "description": "About this framework\n====================\n\nWe are introducing a new competency framework to support the Civil Service Reform Plan and the new\nperformance management system. The competency framework sets out how we want people in the Civil Service to\nwork. It puts the Civil Service values of honesty, integrity, impartiality and objectivity at the heart of everything we\ndo and it aligns to the three high level leadership behaviours that every civil servant needs to model: Set Direction;\nEngage People and Deliver Results. Civil servants work in a huge range of jobs across the country and overseas\nbut one thing we have in common is that we are here to support the elected Government, providing advice to help\nshape its policies and ensuring seamless and practical implementation in line with those policies.\n\nCompetencies are the skills, knowledge and behaviours that lead to successful performance. The framework\noutlines 10 competencies, which are grouped into 3 clusters as set out above. For each competency there is a\ndescription of what it means in practice and some examples of effective and ineffective behaviours at all levels.\nThe competencies are intended to be discrete and cumulative, with each level building on the levels below i.e. a\nperson demonstrating a competency at level 3 should be demonstrating levels 1 and 2 as a matter of course.\nThese indicators of behaviour are not designed to be comprehensive, but provide a clear sense of and greater\nunderstanding and consistency about what is expected from individuals in the Civil Service.\n\n## What does it mean for me?\n\nThe framework will be used for recruitment, performance management and development discussions and for\ndecisions about progression. Some Departments introduced it in April 2012 with the rest of Government doing so\nfrom April 2013. In these new arrangements your business objectives will set out “what” you need to achieve over\nthe year and this competency framework will set out “how” you need to work to achieve those objectives.\n\nMost of you will need to focus on a number of competencies, usually around six, identified with your manager as\nbeing essential to your role. You are encouraged to discuss the framework with your line manager to identify the\ncompetencies that apply most to your job role.\n\nThis framework has been developed in partnership with Civil Service professions. If you work as part of a\nprofession with a separate framework this will complement your professional framework and should be used\nalongside it.\n\nThe framework is made up of ten competencies. Below is a list of all the competencies with a high-level summary\nof each one.\n",
